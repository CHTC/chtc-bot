    <p>Note: more information on submitting HTCondor jobs can be found here:
    <a class="reference internal" href="../users-manual/submitting-a-job.html"><span class="doc">Submitting a Job</span></a>.</p>
    <p>As of version 8.5.6, the <em>condor_submit</em> language supports multi-line
    values in commands. The syntax is the same as the configuration language
    (see more details here:
    <a class="reference internal" href="../admin-manual/introduction-to-configuration.html#multi-line-values"><span class="std std-ref">Multi-Line Values</span></a>).</p>
    <p>Each submit description file describes one or more clusters of jobs to
    be placed in the HTCondor execution pool. All jobs in a cluster must
    share the same executable, but they may have different input and output
    files, and different program arguments. The submit description file is
    generally the last command-line argument to <em>condor_submit</em>. If the
    submit description file argument is omitted, <em>condor_submit</em> will read
    the submit description from standard input.</p>
    <p>The submit description file must contain at least one <em>executable</em>
    command and at least one <em>queue</em> command. All of the other commands have
    default actions.</p>
    <p><strong>Note that a submit file that contains more than one executable command
    will produce multiple clusters when submitted. This is not generally
    recommended, and is not allowed for submit files that are run as DAG node
    jobs by condor_dagman.</strong></p>
    <p>The commands which can appear in the submit description file are
    numerous. They are listed here in alphabetical order by category.</p>
    <p>BASIC COMMANDS <span class="target" id="index-13"></span> </p>
    <blockquote>
    <div><dl class="docutils">
    <dt>arguments = &lt;argument_list&gt;</dt>
    <dd><p class="first">List of arguments to be supplied to the executable as part of the
    command line.</p>
    <p>In the <strong>java</strong> universe, the first argument must be the name of the
    class containing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">main</span></code>.</p>
    <p>There are two permissible formats for specifying arguments,
    identified as the old syntax and the new syntax. The old syntax
    supports white space characters within arguments only in special
    circumstances; when used, the command line arguments are represented
    in the job ClassAd attribute <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Args</span></code>. The new syntax supports
    uniform quoting of white space characters within arguments; when
    used, the command line arguments are represented in the job ClassAd
    attribute <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Arguments</span></code>.</p>
    <p><strong>Old Syntax</strong></p>
    <p>In the old syntax, individual command line arguments are delimited
    (separated) by space characters. To allow a double quote mark in an
    argument, it is escaped with a backslash; that is, the two character
    sequence &quot; becomes a single double quote mark within an argument.</p>
    <p>Further interpretation of the argument string differs depending on
    the operating system. On Windows, the entire argument string is
    passed verbatim (other than the backslash in front of double quote
    marks) to the Windows application. Most Windows applications will
    allow spaces within an argument value by surrounding the argument
    with double quotes marks. In all other cases, there is no further
    interpretation of the arguments.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">arguments</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">one</span> \\<span class="s2">&quot;two</span><span class="se">\\&quot;</span><span class="s2"> &#39;three&#39;</span>
    </pre></div>
    </div>
    <p>Produces in Unix vanilla universe:</p>
    <div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">argument</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">one</span>
    <span class="n">argument</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;two&quot;</span>
    <span class="n">argument</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;three&#39;</span>
    </pre></div>
    </div>
    <p><strong>New Syntax</strong></p>
    <p>Here are the rules for using the new syntax:</p>
    <ol class="arabic simple">
    <li>The entire string representing the command line arguments is
    surrounded by double quote marks. This permits the white space
    characters of spaces and tabs to potentially be embedded within a
    single argument. Putting the double quote mark within the
    arguments is accomplished by escaping it with another double
    quote mark.</li>
    <li>The white space characters of spaces or tabs delimit arguments.</li>
    <li>To embed white space characters of spaces or tabs within a single
    argument, surround the entire argument with single quote marks.</li>
    <li>To insert a literal single quote mark, escape it within an
    argument already delimited by single quote marks by adding
    another single quote mark.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">arguments</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;3 simple arguments&quot;</span>
    </pre></div>
    </div>
    <p>Produces:</p>
    <div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">argument</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
    <span class="n">argument</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">simple</span>
    <span class="n">argument</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">arguments</span>
    </pre></div>
    </div>
    <p>Another example:</p>
    <div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">arguments</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;one &#39;two with spaces&#39; 3&quot;</span>
    </pre></div>
    </div>
    <p>Produces:</p>
    <div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">argument</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">one</span>
    <span class="n">argument</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">two</span> <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">spaces</span>
    <span class="n">argument</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
    </pre></div>
    </div>
    <p>And yet another example:</p>
    <div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">arguments</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;one &quot;&quot;two&quot;&quot; &#39;spacey &#39;&#39;quoted&#39;&#39; argument&#39;&quot;</span>
    </pre></div>
    </div>
    <p>Produces:</p>
    <div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">argument</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">one</span>
    <span class="n">argument</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;two&quot;</span>
    <span class="n">argument</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">spacey</span> <span class="s1">&#39;quoted&#39;</span> <span class="n">argument</span>

    <p class="last">Notice that in the new syntax, the backslash has no special meaning.
    This is for the convenience of Windows users.

    <dt>environment = &lt;parameter_list&gt;</dt>
    <dd><p class="first">List of environment
    <span class="target" id="index-15"></span> variables.</p>
    <p>There are two different formats for specifying the environment
    variables: the old format and the new format. The old format is
    retained for backward-compatibility. It suffers from a
    platform-dependent syntax and the inability to insert some special
    characters into the environment.</p>
    <p>The new syntax for specifying environment values:</p>
    <ol class="arabic">
    <li><p class="first">Put double quote marks around the entire argument string. This
    distinguishes the new syntax from the old. The old syntax does
    not have double quote marks around it. Any literal double quote
    marks within the string must be escaped by repeating the double
    quote mark.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p class="first">Each environment entry has the form</p>
    <div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">&gt;=&lt;</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
    </pre></div>
    </div>
    </li>
    <li><p class="first">Use white space (space or tab characters) to separate environment
    entries.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p class="first">To put any white space in an environment entry, surround the
    space and as much of the surrounding entry as desired with single
    quote marks.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p class="first">To insert a literal single quote mark, repeat the single quote
    mark anywhere inside of a section surrounded by single quote
    marks.</p>
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">environment</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;one=1 two=&quot;&quot;2&quot;&quot; three=&#39;spacey &#39;&#39;quoted&#39;&#39; value&#39;&quot;</span>
    </pre></div>
    </div>
    <p>Produces the following environment entries:</p>
    <div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">one</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="n">two</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;2&quot;</span>
    <span class="n">three</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">spacey</span> <span class="s1">&#39;quoted&#39;</span> <span class="n">value</span>
    </pre></div>
    </div>
    <p>Under the old syntax, there are no double quote marks surrounding
    the environment specification. Each environment entry remains of the
    form</p>
    <div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">&gt;=&lt;</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
    </pre></div>
    </div>
    <p>Under Unix, list multiple environment entries by separating them
    with a semicolon (;). Under Windows, separate multiple entries with
    a vertical bar (|). There is no way to insert a literal semicolon
    under Unix or a literal vertical bar under Windows. Note that spaces
    are accepted, but rarely desired, characters within parameter names
    and values, because they are treated as literal characters, not
    separators or ignored white space. Place spaces within the parameter
    list only if required.</p>
    <p>A Unix example:</p>
    <div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">environment</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">one</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="n">two</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="n">three</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;quotes have no &#39;special&#39; meaning&quot;</span>
    </pre></div>
    </div>
    <p>This produces the following:</p>
    <div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">one</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="n">two</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">2</span>
    <span class="n">three</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;quotes have no &#39;special&#39; meaning&quot;</span>
